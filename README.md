# Temperature-and-humidity-data-logging

# AIM
The aim of our project is to store the varying temperature and humidity values so that it can be used for analytical purposes.

# DESCRIPTION
1) We are reading temperature and humidity using DHT-11 sensor through Arduino board.
2) The temperature and humidity at the given time is seen on the LED.
3) With python we store all the data shown on the LED onto the database. 
4) MYSQL connectivity is used for this purpose.
5) The change in temperature and humidity every second can be seen in the database.
